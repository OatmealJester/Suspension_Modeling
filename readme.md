## How to Navigate this Repository

There are two folders we will be using:

**SUSPENSION_MODELING** 
* Project-Assignment.nb: This the file that has the problems we need to solve and the related data we need for the project

* EEL-3135-RVAA-gg.nb: This is the submission file what we work on / send to the professor 

**RESOURCES**
* Template.nb: This is our template file do not edit it as we are going to refrence it for our submission, in the beginning of this project the template and EEL-3135-RVAA-gg.nb should look the same. The goal is to not keep it that way.

* Other Files: These files are some of the resources our professor gave us on Canvas. I am not listing these files explicitly because they are not critical to the submission of the project
